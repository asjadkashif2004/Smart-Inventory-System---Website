## **🛠️ Backend Working (Step by Step)**  

### **1️⃣ User Authentication**  
- Users register through the `/register` route, and data (name, email, hashed password) is stored in the database.  
- Users log in via `/login`, where the email and password are verified.  
- If successful, Flask-Login creates a session for the user.  
- Admins can log in with special credentials for extra privileges.  

### **2️⃣ Product Management (CRUD Operations)**
- **View Products:**  
  - The `/dashboard` route fetches all products from the database and displays them.  
- **Add Products:**  
  - The `/add_product` route handles the form submission and adds the product to the database.  
- **Edit Products:**  
  - The `/edit_product/<id>` route fetches a product’s data, allows modifications, and updates it in the database.  
- **Delete Products:**  
  - The `/delete_product/<id>` route removes the product from the database after admin confirmation.  

### **3️⃣ Flash Messages & UI Updates**
- Flash messages notify users about successful operations (e.g., "Product Added Successfully").  
- Bootstrap modals & alerts enhance the UI/UX.
